## Resolving CORS Errors

If you encounter CORS errors while testing the API, consider using a browser extension to bypass CORS restrictions:

- For Chrome: [CORS Unblock](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino?hl=en)
- For Firefox: [CORS Everywhere](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/)

These extensions can help you access resources from different origins during development.
